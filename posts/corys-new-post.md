## Installation

Upon installation this snap will not try to run any daemons until the `physical-memory-control` and `network-control` interfaces have been connected and `snap.mode` config has been set to a supported value.

#### Install form Snapstore

```bash
sudo snap install slurm
```

#### Connect Interfaces

Connect the `physical-memory-control` and `network-control` interfaces:

```bash
sudo snap connect slurm:network-control
sudo snap connect slurm:physical-memory-control
```

#### Set `snap.mode` Config

The following `snap.mode` values are supported:

- `none`
- `all`
- `login`
- `munged`
- `slurmdbd`
- `slurmctld`
- `slurmd`
- `slurmrestd`

To configure this snap to run a different set of daemons, just set the `snap.mode`:

```bash
sudo snap set slurm snap.mode=all
```

The above command configures the `snap.mode` to `all` mode. This runs all of the Slurm daemons including MySQL and Munged in a all in one local development mode.

`all` mode is a core feature of this software, as there currently exists no other way to provision a fully functioning slurm cluster for development use.

When the above steps have been completed you will have a Slurm deploy running inside the snap.
